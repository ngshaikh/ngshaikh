## NIZAMUDDIN SHAIKH
### I am an avid programmer and a computer enthusiast! 😃
- I am a self learnt programmer.
- I learnt HTML, CSS, Less, JavaScript, NodeJS, ExpressJS, KoaJS, Pug, Sqlite3, neDB, MongoDB, Python, Adobe Illustrator and Figma - all by myself.
- I learnt all these, through extensive use of internet - particularly online books and videos.
- I tried whatever I learnt that way, in my own practicles.
- Now, I wish to share some of my practicles which may be of use to other people.

## I am currently learning
- How to use pug in KoaJS

## I am also working on
- A project named **PaymentsTracker**
- This project is in **Express and uses sqlite3 as database**
- This tracks payments made from different accounts and reconciles them
- I shall upload this project on GitHub when it is fully functional
- I shall do the same project in KoaJS thereafter.

## My future projects
1) Personal Investment Tracker
3) Inventory System for Pharmaceutical companies
4) Fulfledged accounts system 

## I am very much interested in
- Web development 
- Web designing
- Customised accounts 
- User Interface
- User Experience
- Data Science 
- Data Analysis

## I am interested in collaboration on
- Projects that require accounts reconciliation
- Projects which aim at medical diagnostic data analysis

I look forward to a progressive, proactive future on GitHub.
