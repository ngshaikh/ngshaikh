## NIZAMUDDIN SHAIKH
### I am an avid programmer and a computer enthusiast! 😃
- I am a self learnt programmer.
- I learnt HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, ExpressJS, KoaJS, Pug, neDB, MongoDB, Python, Adobe Illustrator and Figma - all by myself.
- I learnt all these, through extensive use of internet - particularly online books and videos.
- I tried whatever I learnt that way, in my own practicles.
- Now, I wish to share some of my practicles which may be of use to other people.

## I am currently learning
- How to use pug in KoaJS

## I am also working on
- A project named PaymentsTracker
- This project is in Express and uses sqlite3 as database
- This tracks payments made from different accounts and reconciles them
- I shall upload this project on GitHub when it is fully functional
- I shall do the same project in KoaJS thereafter.

## I am very much interested in
- Web development 
- Web designing
- User Interface
- User Experience
- Data Analysis
- Data Science 

## I am interested in collaboration on
- Projects that require accounts reconciliation
- Projects which aim at medical diagnostic data analysis

## How to reach me
- My email is ngshaikh@hotmail.com

I look forward to a progressive, proactive future on GitHub.
