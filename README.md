## NIZAMUDDIN SHAIKH
- I am a self taught programmer.
- I learnt HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, ExpressJS, KoaJs, Pug, Python and Adobe Illustrator, Figma - all by myself.
- I learnt all these, through extensive use of internet - particularly books and videos.
- I tried whatever I learnt that way, in my own practicles.
- Now, I wish to share some of my practicles which may be of use to learners.

## I am currently learning
- Using pug in KoaJS

## I am also working on
- One project named PaymentsTracker
- This project is in Express 
- This tracks payments made from different accounts and reconciles them
- I shall upload this project on GitHub when it is fully functional
- I shall do the same project in KoaJS after that.

## I am very much interested in
- Web development, Web designing
- User Interface
- User Experience
- Data Science 

## I am interested in collaboration on
- Projects that require accounts reconciliation
- Projects which require data analysis

## How to reach me
- My email is ngshaikh@hotmail.com

I look forward to a progressive future on GitHub.
